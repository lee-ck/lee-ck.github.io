### Nonlinear controller ### 

- **Backstepping Control**: A nonlinear control technique that is used to design controllers for complex systems with uncertain dynamics.

- **Sliding Mode Control**: A robust control technique that forces a system trajectory to stay on a specific sliding surface, which is used to achieve the desired control performance.

- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: A nonlinear control technique that predicts the future behavior of a system based on a model of its dynamics, and then uses this prediction to optimize a control input sequence.

- **Adaptive Control**: A control technique that adjusts the control parameters of a controller in real-time to account for changes in a system's dynamics or external disturbances.

- **Feedback Linearization**: A nonlinear control technique that transforms a nonlinear system into a linear one by introducing a feedback loop that cancels out the nonlinearities in the system's dynamics.


### Linear controller ### 

- **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control**: A widely used control technique that adjusts the control output based on the error between the desired setpoint and the measured output of a system.

- **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Control**: A type of optimal control that minimizes a quadratic cost function based on the system's state and control inputs.

- **Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) Control**: A control technique that combines optimal control and Kalman filtering to achieve the control objective in the presence of measurement noise.
